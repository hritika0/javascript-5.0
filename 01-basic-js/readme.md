VARIABLE:-
- variable is container to store some data.
- in javascript we have 3 types of variables
1. let:-
    - Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
    - Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
    - Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.
2. var:-
    - Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
    - var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are dont use var most of the time.
3. const:-
    - Const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
    - const means constant to store some data like numbers,integer etc..

TASKS :-

2. difference between var & const.
3. what do you mean by haisting.(when we dont declare value of variable but it execute the code)
