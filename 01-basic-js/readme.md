what is javascript and why we used it ?

- javascript is logic based programming language where we can create our code project functionality in that.
- javascript is a high level programming language for build web pages.
- now we used the ES6(echma script 6) version of javascript, in other words we called vanila javascript.
- runtime enviroment of javascript is node js.

VARIABLE:-
- variable is container to store some data.
- in javascript we have 3 types of variables
1. let:-
    - Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
    - Now these days, most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
    - Let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases.
2. var:-
    - Var is a type of variable which is also used for changing the variable later stage.
    - var is used in oldest browser so now a days we are dont use var most of the time.
3. const:-
    - Const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
    - const means constant to store some data like numbers,integer etc..

TASKS :-
1. difference between let & var.
2. difference between var & const.
3. what do you mean by haisting.(when we dont declare value of variable but it execute the code)

Rules of Variable :-
  - Variable names are case sensative "a" & "A" is different.
  - only letter, digit, underscore & $ is allowed. (not even space).
  - only letter, underscore or $ should be 1st character.
  - reserver words cannot be variable names.

  data types in javascript :-

  - data type is an attribute associated with a piece of data that tells a computer system how to interpret its value.
  - in data types we used "typeof" operator to know the what type of data it is.
  - mainly in javascript their are 2 types of data type.

  1. Primitive :-
      - in javascript there are 7 types of primitive data types.
      1. Number :- number are the type of data type those it contain some numerical value.
      2. string :- string is a type of data type that can hold some character like name...
      3. Boolean :- In boolean data types we get Boolean value like true, false
      4. undefined :- in undefined data type the data is not define so that it will show undefined.
      5. Null :- in this data type we get null for the value means nothing
      6. bigint :- in bigint we will get big integer
      7. Symbol :- in symbol we will get whole symbol as well as the value we get for the data type.

  2. Non-primitive or Reference 
      - non primitive data types are the type of data type that can hold multiple items in a single time
      - non primitive data types are - object, array, function
      object :- 
         - object is a non primitive data types which can hold multiple of item in one single entity.
         - mainly objects are working on (key:value) pair.
         - the left hand side is our keys and right hand side are the  values of the following object.

         ex - 
           
        jyoti = {
            college : "HITECH",
            addres : "BBSR",
            age : 20,
            salary : 50000,
            carrier : "Good"
        }


Operator in JS :- 
  - operator are the key features to do some task or operate some task.
  - ex. A + B
  - in the above example A & B are the operands , '+' is the operators to do the addition.
  1. ARITHMETIC OPERATOR :-
  (+,-,*,/)
  modulous-> %
  exponention -> **
  increment-> ++
  decrement ->--
